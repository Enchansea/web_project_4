# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

* Intro
* Plans
* Website

**Intro**

This is my fourth website project. Inside are elements of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project is an interactive website about places around the world. In this project I explored grid layout to display pictures and worked on pop up forms to change the content of the website. I also used @media inquiries to make the website viewable on different screen sizes. Namely: 1200, 768, and 425.

**Plans**

In the future I plan on making the "like" hearts interactive with JavaScript. I also want in include more content in the page. Maybe even make the pictures interactive so they can be changed by the user.
