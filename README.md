# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

* Intro
* Plans
* Website

**Intro**

This is my fourth website project. Inside are elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is an interactive website about places around the world. In this project, I explored the grid layout to display pictures and worked on pop up forms to change the content of the website. I also used @media inquiries to make the website viewable on different screen sizes. Namely: 1200, 768, and 425.

**Plans**

In the future, I plan on making the "like" hearts interactive with JavaScript. I also want to include more content on the page. Maybe even make the pictures interactive so they can be changed by the user.

**Version 1.1**
In this iteration I have made some of the planned changes I included in my Plans section. I changed my HTML to pull a template with JavaScript to create cards of each place. Also, the forms have become more interactive. You can now open, close, or submit these pop-up forms/pictures as needed. The forms are interactable and can change the website according to the input put into each field. I also implemented the interactive "like" hearts.
